    "## Installation and Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need ROS version Indigo or newer (wiki.ros.org).\n",
    "The software was developed on Ubuntu Linux 16.04 LTS with ROS Kinetic,\n",
    "but has also been tested on Ubuntu Linux 14.04 LTS with ROS Indigo.\n",
    "Newer versions of ROS should work, but may need some adaptation.\n",
    "See below for version specific instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Download the `bio_ik` package and unpack into your catkin workspace.\n",
    "* Run `catkin_make` to compile your workspace:\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "    roscd\n",
    "    cd src\n",
    "    git clone https://github.com/TAMS-Group/bio_ik.git\n",

    "* Configure Moveit to use bio-ik as the kinematics solver (see next section).\n",
    "* Use Moveit to plan and execute motions or use your own code\n",
    "  together with `move_group` node to move your robot.\n",
    "* As usual, the public API is specified in the public header files for the `bio_ik` package,\n",
    "  located in the `include/bio_ik` subdirectory; \n",
    "  the sources including a few private header files are in the `src` subdirectory.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "For ease of use and compatibility with existing code, \n",
    "the bio-ik algorithm is encapsulated as a Moveit kinematics plugin.\n",
    "Therefore, bio-ik can be used as a direct replacement of\n",
    "the default Orocos/KDL-based IK solver.\n",
    "Given the name of an end-effector and a 6-DOF target pose,\n",
    "bio-ik will search a valid robot joint configuration that reaches the given target.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our tests (see below), both in terms of success rate and solution time,\n",
    "bio-ik regularly outperformed the Orocos [1] solver\n",
    "and is competitive with trac-ik [2].\n",
    "The bio-ik algorithm can also be used for high-DOF system like robot snakes,\n",
    "and it will automatically converge to the best approximate solutions\n",
    "for low-DOF arms where some target poses are not reachable exactly.\n",
    "\n",
    "While you can write the Moveit configuration files by hand, \n",
    "the easiest way is to run the Moveit setup assistant for your robot, \n",
    "and then to select bio-ik as the IK solver when configuring the end effectors.\n",
    "Once configured, the solver can be called using the standard Moveit API\n",
    "or used interactively from rviz using the MotionPlanning GUI plugin.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Make sure that you have a URDF (or xacro) model for your robot.\n",
    "* Run the moveit setup assistant to create the Moveit configuration files:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  rosrun moveit_setup_assistant moveit_setup_assistant\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "*  The setup assistant automatically searches for all available IK solver plugins\n",
    "  in your workspace. \n",
    "  Therefore, you can just select select bio-ik as the IK solver \n",
    "  from the drop-down list for every end effector and then configure \n",
    "  the kinematics parameters, namely the default position accuracy (meters)\n",
    "  and the timeout (in seconds). For typical 6-DOF or 7-DOF arms,\n",
    "  an accuracy of 0.001 m (or smaller) and a timeout of 1 msec should be ok.\n",
    "  More complex robots might need a longer timeout.\n",
    "* Generate the moveit configuration files from the setup assistant.\n",
    "  Of course, you can also edit the `config/kinematics.yaml` configuration\n",
    "  file with your favorite text editor. \n",

    "* two-arm manipulation tasks on two-arm robots (e.g. Baxter)\n",

    "* reaching tasks with additional constraints (e.g. shoulder position)\n",
    "* incremental tool motions without robot arm configuration changes\n",
    "* and many more\n",

    "The algorithm then tries to find a robot configuration\n",
    "that fulfills all given goals simultaneously by minimizing \n",
    "a quadratic error function built from the weighted individual goals.\n",
    "While the current Moveit API does not support multiple-goals tasks directly,\n",
    "it provides the KinematicQueryOptions class.\n",
    "Therefore, bio-ik simply provides a set of predefined motion goals,\n",
    "and a combination of the user-specified goals is passed via Moveit to the IK solver.\n",
    "No API changes are required in Moveit, but using the IK solver now consists\n",
    "passing the weighted goals via the KinematicQueryOptions.\n",
    "The predefined goals include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* *PoseGoal*: a full 6-DOF robot pose\n",
    "* *PositionGoal*: a 3-DOF (x,y,z) position\n",

    "* *LookAtGoal*: a 3-DOF (x,y,z) position intended as a looking direction\n",
    "   for a camera or robot head\n",
    "* *JointGoal*: a set of joint angles, e.g. to specify a \n",

    "\n",
    "The bio-ik solver is based on a memetic algorithm that combines \n",

    "and particle-swarm optimization [3].\n",
    "See [4] for the basic idea and the details of the evolutionary operators \n",
    "and [5] for the description of the algorithm applied to many IK and manipulation tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Internally, vectors of all robot joint values are used to encode\n",
    "different intermediate solutions (the *genotype* of the genetic algorithm).\n",
    "During the optimization, joint values are always checked against the\n",
    "active lower and upper joint limits, so that only valid robot configurations\n",
    "are generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate the fitness of individuals, the cumulative error over all\n",
    "given individual goals is calculated. \n",
    "Any individual with zero error is an exact solution for the IK problem, \n",
    "while individuals with small error correspond to approximate solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Individuals are sorted by their fitness, and gradient-based optimization\n",
    "is tried on the best few configuration, resulting in fast convergence \n",
    "and good performance for many problems. \n",
    "If no solution is found from the gradient-based optimization,\n",
    "new individuals are created by a set of mutation and recombination operators,\n",
    "resulting in good search-space exploration.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example Performance data\n",
    "\n",
    "To be written.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Running the Self-Tests\n",
    "\n",
    "We have tested bio-ik on many different robot arms,\n",
    "both using the tranditional single end-effector API\n",
    "and the advanced multi end-effector API based on the KinematicsQueryOptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "One simple selftest consists of generating random valid robot configurations, \n",
    "running forward kinematics to calculate the resulting end-effector pose,\n",
    "and the querying the IK plugin to find a suitable robot joint configuration.\n",
    "Success is then checked by running forrward kinematics again and checking\n",
    "that the end-effector pose for the generated IK solution matches the target pose.\n",
    "This approach can be run easily for thousands or millions of random poses,\n",
    "samples the full workspace of the robot,\n",
    "and allows to quickly generate success-rate and solution-time estimates\n",
    "for the selected IK solver.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, running the tests requires installing the corresponding robot\n",
    "models and adds a lot of dependencies. \n",
    "Therefore, those tests are not included in the standard bio-ik package,\n",
    "but are packaged separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "For convenience, we provide the `pr2_bioik_moveit` package,\n",
    "which also includes a few bio-ik demos for the PR2 service robot.\n",
    "These are kinematics only demos; but of course you can also try\n",
    "running the demos on the real robot (if you have one) or the Gazebo\n",
    "simulator (if you installed Gazebo).\n",
    "\n",
